						instant messaging service.

Sample Requirements				The plugin was created using the Xcode editor running

About the sample				A Quartz Composer plug-in that implements a custom 
						provider patch that outputs the user instant messaging 
						status as well as for his or her buddies.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
						in /Developer/Applications. From the main menu, 
						choose "Project", set "Active Configuration" to "Release", 
						and "Active Target" to "Build & Copy".  These settings are
						also available from the top left corner of the 'Overview'

						get the information such as "statusImage", "statusTitle",
