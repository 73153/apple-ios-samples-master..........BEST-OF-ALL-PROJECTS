    Abstract:
    
                The \c AAPLListController and \c AAPLListControllerDelegate infrastructure provide a mechanism for other objects within the application to be notified of inserts, removes, and updates to \c AAPLListInfo objects. In addition, it also provides a way for parts of the application to present errors that occured when creating or removing lists.

 * The \c AAPLListController class is responsible for tracking \c AAPLListInfo objects that are found through
 * list controller's \c AAPLListCoordinator object. \c AAPLListCoordinator objects are responsible for
 * notifying the list controller of inserts, removes, updates, and errors when interacting with a list's
 * URL. Since the work of searching, removing, inserting, and updating \c AAPLListInfo objects is done
 * by the list controller's coordinator, the list controller serves as a way to avoid the need to interact
 * with a single \c AAPLListCoordinator directly throughout the application. It also allows the rest
 * of the application to deal with \c AAPLListInfo objects rather than dealing with their \c NSURL
 * instances directly. In essence, the work of a list controller is to "front" its current coordinator.
 * All changes that the coordinator relays to the \c AAPLListController object will be relayed to the
 * list controller's delegate. This ability to front another object is particularly useful when the
 * underlying coordinator changes. As an example, this could happen when the user changes their storage
 * option from using local documents to using cloud documents. If the coordinator property of the list
 * controller changes, other objects throughout the application are unaffected since the list controller 
 * will notify them of the appropriate changes (removes, inserts, etc.).
