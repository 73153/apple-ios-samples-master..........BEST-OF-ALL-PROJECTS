 * moved or inserted at a certain index, to perform those move and insert operations, to toggle an
 * item between a complete and incomplete state, and to fetch list items by index. Note that in order
 * to be able to archive and unarchive \c AAPLList objects in both the Objective-C and Swift versions
 * of the app, the Swift version of the app ensures that the runtime name of its \c List object is
 * also \c AAPLList.
