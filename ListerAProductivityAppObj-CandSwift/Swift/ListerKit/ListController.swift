                The `ListController` and `ListControllerDelegate` infrastructure provide a mechanism for other objects within the application to be notified of inserts, removes, and updates to `ListInfo` objects. In addition, it also provides a way for parts of the application to present errors that occured when creating or removing lists.

    The `ListControllerDelegate` protocol enables a `ListController` object to notify other objects of changes

    events, inserts, removes, updates, and errors. Note that the `ListController` can call these methods

/**
    The `ListController` class is responsible for tracking `ListInfo` objects that are found through
    list controller's `ListCoordinator` object. `ListCoordinator` objects are responsible for notifying
    the list controller of inserts, removes, updates, and errors when interacting with a list's URL.
    Since the work of searching, removing, inserting, and updating `ListInfo` objects is done by the list
    controller's coordinator, the list controller serves as a way to avoid the need to interact with a single
    `ListCoordinator` directly throughout the application. It also allows the rest of the application
    to deal with `ListInfo` objects rather than dealing with their `NSURL` instances directly. In essence,
    the work of a list controller is to "front" its current coordinator. All changes that the coordinator
    relays to the `ListController` object will be relayed to the list controller's delegate. This ability to
    front another object is particularly useful when the underlying coordinator changes. As an example,
    this could happen when the user changes their storage option from using local documents to using
    cloud documents. If the coordinator property of the list controller changes, other objects throughout
    the application are unaffected since the list controller will notify them of the appropriate
    changes (removes, inserts, etc.).
