Quartz Composer Plugin

iPatch						A Quartz Composer plug-in that converts any name to an "iName".

Sample Requirements				The plugin was created using the Xcode editor running 
						under Mac OS X 10.6.x or later. 

About the sample				A Quartz Composer plug-in that implements a custom 
						processor patch that turns strings into "iStrings".

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
						in /Developer/Applications. From the main menu, 
						choose "Project", set "Active Configuration" to "Release", 
						and "Active Target" to "Build & Copy".  These settings are
						also available from the top left corner of the 'Overview' 
						pull-down window. Build the project. Once the build has 
						completed successfully, the plug-in can be used as a 
						regular QC patch in the Quartz Composer editor (also 
						installed under /Developer/Applications), by selecting it 
						from the Library - Plugin panel.

						Put a string in the plug-in input port "Name", this patch 
						will capitalize the first letter if it is not in upper 
						case, and add an "i" in front of the string.
