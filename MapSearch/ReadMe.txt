MapSearch

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Demonstrates how to programmatically search for map-based addresses and points of interest using the MKLocalSearch class.  It initiates a search for map-based content using a natural language string.  A user can type "coffee", press search and it will find all the coffee places nearby.  The places found are centered around the user's current location. Once the search results have been found, the sample shows various ways to display the results.  It demonstrates how to use MKLocalSearchCompletionHandler and populate the UITableView with the search results.  

Each found place can be viewed in it's own MKMapView to show a single annotation or a cluster of annotations describing the search results.
