# Table Search with UISearchController

This sample demonstrates how to use UISearchController. A search controller manages the presentation of a search bar (in concert with the results view controllerâ€™s content).  It also demonstrates how to use UIStateRestoration to restore the search controller.

## Written in Objective-C and Swift

This sample is written in both Objective-C and Swift. Both versions of the sample are at the top level directory of this project in folders named "Objective-C" and "Swift". Both versions of the application have the exact same visual appearance; however, the code and structure may be different depending on the choice of language.

## Build

Building this sample requires Xcode 6.1.1 and iOS 8.1 SDK

## Runtime

Running the sample requires iOS 8.0 or later.
    Both targets use Storyboards and Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).
