StoreKitSuite consists of the iOSInAppPurchases and IAPStoreProductViewController sample codes that demonstrate how to implement In-App Purchase.

iOSInAppPurchases demonstrates how to retrieve, display, purchase, download, and restore In-App Purchase products using SKRequestDelegate, SKProductsRequestDelegate, SKProductsResponse, and SKPaymentTransactionObserver's paymentQueue:updatedTransactions: and paymentQueue: updatedDownloads:. It displays available products for sale and invalid product identifiers returned from the App Store using SKProduct, displays purchase information using SKPaymentTransaction, and hosted productâ€™s download progress using SKDownload's progress.


IAPStoreProductViewController demonstrates how to use SKStoreProductViewController to display items available for sale in the App Store from within an application.
