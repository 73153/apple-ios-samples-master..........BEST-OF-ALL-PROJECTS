# AppPrefs: Storing and Retrieving User Preferences #

This sample demonstrates how to display your app's user configurable options (preferences) in the "Settings" system application.  A settings bundle, included in your applicationâ€™s bundle directory, contains the information needed by the Settings application to display your preferences and make it possible for the user to modify them.  The Settings application saves any configured values in the defaults database so that your application can retrieve them at runtime. 

This sample also shows how to launch the Settings app from your application and how to dynamically update your application's UI when its settings are changed while the app is in the background.

### USING THE SAMPLE: ###

Launch the AppPrefs project using Xcode.
Make sure the project's current target is set to "AppPrefs".
Build and run the "AppPrefs" target.

When launched notice the text, and its color. Tap the "Settings" button to launch the Settings application.  At the end of the settings list you will find a section for "AppPrefs".  From there you can set the first and last name, and the text color. Switch back to AppPrefs and notice the settings have changed.

### FURTHER INFORMATION: ###

For more information on extending the Settings application, refer to the "Preferences and Settings Programming Guide" and the "Settings Application Schema Reference".
