# BracketStripes: Using the Bracketed Capture API

BracketStripes

This sample illustrates the use of still image bracketing APIs available in AVFoundation.

Two types of brackets are demonstrated:

1. Auto-exposure brackets with exposure target bias, and
1. Manual exposure with control over ISO and exposure duration.

As each of the bracketed frames are captured in real-time, they are "striped" into a destination image buffer and later shown in a modal image viewer so each of the captured frames can be compared side-by-side.

## Requirements
