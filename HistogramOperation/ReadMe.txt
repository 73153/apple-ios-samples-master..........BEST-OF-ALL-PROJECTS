						according to the histogram of another image.

About the sample				A Quartz Composer plug-in that implements a custom 
						processor patch that alters an image according to the 
						histogram of another image using the vImage framework.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
						in /Developer/Applications. From the main menu, 
						choose "Project", set "Active Configuration" to "Release", 
						and "Active Target" to "Build & Copy".  These settings are
						also available from the top left corner of the 'Overview' 
						pull-down window. Build the project. Once the build has 
						completed successfully, the plug-in can be used as a 
						regular QC patch in the Quartz Composer editor (also 
						installed under /Developer/Applications), by selecting it 
						from the Library - Plugin panel.

						The image whose histogram is going to be changed is in the 
						plug-in input parameter "Source Image". The image whose 
						histogram will influence the result is in input parameter 
						"Histogram Image".
