PhotosByLocation
======================

Demonstrates how to use the AssetsLibrary APIs to provide a custom image picking UI. The user experience is centered around the idea of using the assets location and time metadata as a basis for certain features.

Assets need to be synced to the device from iTunes to show up in the picker. Ensure you allow Location Services and assets should have location information in the metadata to demonstrate all the functionality of this sample.
