Quartz Composer Plugin

SQLiteQuery					A Quartz Composer plug-in that performs a query on a 
						local SQLite database.

Sample Requirements				The plugin was created using the Xcode editor running 
						under Mac OS X 10.6.x or later. 

About the sample				A Quartz Composer plug-in that queries synchronously a 
						SQLite 3 database on disk and outputs the results as a 
						structure. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless,
						zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database
						engine. SQLite reads and writes a complete SQL database
						to a single disk file. It is a popular database engine
						choice on memory constrained gadgets. This plug-in 
						retrieves information from a SQLite database.
						Given a SQLite database and a SQL query, the result 
						will be returned. The default database path is set to 
						Database.db which can be found in this sample.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
						in /Developer/Applications. From the main menu, 
						choose "Project", set "Active Configuration" to "Release", 
						and "Active Target" to "Build & Copy".  These settings are
						also available from the top left corner of the 'Overview' 
						pull-down window. Build the project. Once the build has 
						completed successfully, the plug-in can be used as a 
						regular QC patch in the Quartz Composer editor (also 
						installed under /Developer/Applications), by selecting it 
						from the Library - Plugin panel.

						This plug-in requires the query and the database path in 
						the input ports. The results are returned in the output 
						port "Result Structure".
